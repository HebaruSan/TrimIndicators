TrimIndicators is based on code from Nereid's NanoGauges.

NanoGauges used to have trim indicators, but they broke back around 1.3.1, and because of that Nereid removed them from the mod.

This code is based on the old code, it has been updated to work with the current versions of KSP.

I've offered to Nereid to readd these to his NanoGauges mod, but I wanted this as a standalone mod because this is only 6k in size, while the whole NanoGauges is over 260k in size, and I didn't want/need any of the other gauges

Simply install into the GameData.  There are no configurable items

This mod adds trim pointers to the three axis display during flight:  Roll, Yaw and Pitch.  The trim pointer is a smaller version of the pointer on the opposite side of the scale from the regular pointer
